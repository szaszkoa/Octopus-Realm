# Octopus-Realm
My first attempt at a personal project, meaning horrible spaghetti code awaits if you take a look at it.


## Background

Since i like incremental games, i had the idea to create a basic game to practice TS, HTML and CSS, as my first personal project. So here it goes.

## Goal of the game

General end-goal is to help Octopi achieve total world hegemony, by the means of conquering the surface world. Octopus sciense will be introduced later in time.

## Release notes

v0.0.01
  - resource "shellfish" created.
  - resurce/class octopus created. should be moved into an actual "octopus class" later on. As game data expands, it will be separated based on logical rules of separation.
  - game starts with 0 shellfish and 0 octopus.
    - 1 octopus costs 100 shellfish
    - 1 octopus generates shellfishPerClick amount of shellfish every 1 second
